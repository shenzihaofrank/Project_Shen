# Project_Car_Fuel_Consumption
# Questions in general
1. What factors may affect the car fuel consumption?
2. Is the weather one of the factors?
3. Can fuel type affect the consumption?
4. Can speed affect the fuel consumption?

# What datasets do I need to answer the questions?
The datasets that include the information of the following:
1. Distance
2. Speed
3. Temperature
4. AC used or not
5. Gas type
6. Weather condition

# The metrics list above can help to figure out the car fuel consumption.

# The steps/plan to accomplish my data analysis:
1. Find all the datasets needed and put them together on a same sheet.
2. Compare two of the metrics each time to see what metrics affect the fuel consumption most.
3. Data visualizations - make graphs or tables to show the relationship of each metrics.
